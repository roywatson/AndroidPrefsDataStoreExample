This is a simple example that strips out a lot of generally accepted architectural components and other proclaimed best practices. It is using the minimum of dependencies, frameworks and libraries in order to avoid obscuring the illustration of using androidx's *PreferencesDataStore*. 

##### Branches:

"start" branch is the raw templated project created by Android Studio Chipmunk | 2021.2.1 Patch 2. This is supplied for comparison purposes.  ***It appears you are currently on this branch.***

"complete" branch is the example/tutorial application where the "magic"üòÄ happens. 

##### This example demonstrates/teaches:

- Preferences DataStore API

##### This example also includes/uses:

- Kotlin
- Compose
- ViewModel
- Coroutines & Flows
- Repository pattern

### How to best use this demo:

The starting point of this app was the template for a new project in Android Studio Chipmunk | 2021.2.1 Patch 2 called ‚ÄúEmpty Compose Activity‚Äù and using Kotlin. You can create an empty project based on that template and compare it to this project to discern what needs to be done to get your project started with the Room database library. 

First, as always, we need to add the neccessary dependencies to the project. In the app level build.gradle file I hsve marked my additions with comments. These additions might in turn require version updates to other dependencies and settings. Once you have made my additions, Android Studio will help you identify the other required changes. Be patient as it might take a few iterations and pay close attention to the build output messages.	

First, in com.delasystems.prefsdatastore.data.MyPreferences.kt, I created a data class to hold the preferences and a sealed class that defines and describes the contents of the fields in the data class container.

Next I created a repository to handle the actual storing and retrieval of the preferences. The methods in the repository are called from the ViewModel in response to stimuli from the UI in MainActivity.

You can find a reference to using this API at https://developer.android.com/codelabs/android-preferences-datastore#4 .
